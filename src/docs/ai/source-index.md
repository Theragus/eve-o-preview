# Complete source index and review scope

Baseline: `60944b521e3c5b442dd379b5208c53a91ae3a573`, reviewed 2026-09-06. This inventory contains all **208 tracked baseline files**: 191 under `src/`, 17 elsewhere. Paths in the tables are relative to the Git root. Newly added AI guides/instruction files are listed separately at the end, not included in the baseline count.

The application, Robin, tests, Mock, configuration, message/handler classes, native bindings, project files, release code, designer wiring and textual resources were reviewed across the subsystem guides. Repeated generated wrappers and resource schemas were inspected for their role, control wiring and payload boundaries. This inventory is a navigation and coverage record, not an assertion that every defect has been found.

Binary/resource treatment: icon and partner image metadata were inspected, not their pixels; MainForm's embedded icons were decoded for metadata; the release CSS font is a binary payload. The public certificate was inspected without importing it and contains no private key. Both GPL v3 files were identified and verified byte-identical; this was not a license/legal audit. `assets/stuff.zip` contains `stuff.7z`; the inner archive was not unpacked or audited and no build reference to it was found in the reviewed release code. None of these payloads was executed.

Excluded from source review: ignored package/download caches, `bin`/`obj`/`publish`, `.vs`, generated local state, user settings, logs, profiles and temporary output. There are no tracked `tools` sources at this baseline; [the build workflow](../../../.github/workflows/build.yml) was added later, see [build and test](build-and-test.md). The local `.vscode` directory was empty. The IDE log name in the task did not supply log contents. That baseline documentation review did not run applications/tests/native hooks. The subsequent defect investigation did; see [validation scope](build-and-test.md) and [results](reported-bugs.md).

Use [the entry guide](../../README.md) to route by feature; use this page when a file is unfamiliar. Namespaces and filenames are not always identical, and some tracked files are intentionally excluded from compilation.
