## Overview

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple way to keep an eye on several simultaneously running EVE Online clients and to easily switch between them. While running it shows a set of live thumbnails for each of the active EVE Online clients. These thumbnails allow fast switch to the corresponding EVE Online client either using mouse or configurable hotkeys.

It's essentially a task switcher, it does not relay any keyboard/mouse events and suchlike. The application works with EVE, EVE through Steam, or any combination thereof.

The program does NOT (and will NOT ever) do the following things:

* modify EVE Online interface
* display modified EVE Online interface
* broadcast any keyboard or mouse events
* anyhow interact with EVE Online in a way that changes gameplay or provides an unfair advantage.

Two optional features, the FPS limiter and audio muting (FPS / Audio tab), work differently from the rest of the program: they load a small helper library ("Robin") into the EVE client process to pace its frame presentation and to stop selected sounds. Robin sends no input, reads no game state and talks only to EVE-O Preview over a private pipe, but it does modify the running client in the technical sense. If you prefer EVE-O Preview to never touch the EVE process, leave both features disabled: nothing is then injected, and every other feature works as usual.

**Under any conditions you should NOT use EVE-O Preview for any actions that break EULA or ToS of EVE Online.**

If you have find out that some of the features or their combination of EVE-O Preview might cause actions that can be considered as breaking EULA or ToS of EVE Online you should consider them as a bug and immediately notify the Developer ( Aura Asuna ) via Discord.

## How To Install & Use

1. (Optional) Trust the Eve-O Preview Root Certificate to reduce issues with Antivirus false positives by running the below command in Powershell (e.g. Windows Key + R and type powershell):
    
       powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command', 'Invoke-WebRequest -Uri ''https://github.com/EveOPlus/eve-o-preview/releases/download/10.0.0.4/EveoPreviewRootCA.crt'' -OutFile ''$env:TEMP\cert.crt''; Import-Certificate -FilePath ''$env:TEMP\cert.crt'' -CertStoreLocation ''Cert:\LocalMachine\Root''; Remove-Item ''$env:TEMP\cert.crt'''"
    
3. Download and extract the contents of the .zip archive to a location of your choice (ie: Desktop, CCP folder, etc)
..**Note**: While we make a best effort to support installing the program into *Program Files* or *Program files (x86)* folders. These folders in general do not allow applications to write anything there while EVE-O Preview stores its logs and configuration files next to its executable, thus making it difficult to support.
4. Start up both EVE-O Preview and your EVE Clients (the order does not matter)
5. Adjust settings as you see fit. Program options are described below

Video Guides:

## EVE Online EULA/ToS

This application attempts to be legal under the EULA/ToS:

**Note**: CCP have adopted a stance that they "will not authorize or otherwise sanction the use of any third party software." and "Please use such third party applications or other software at your own risk."

With that said, any feature in Eve-O Preview that could be used for cheating or gaining an in game advantage, is not our intention, must be considered a bug, and reported immediately.

e.g. https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/client-modification-the-eula-and-you
>It should be clear to everybody that we have no interest in banning people who do not do anything bad in New Eden.

and

>Our stance on third-party software is that we do not endorse such software as we have no control over what it does. As such, we can’t say that multiboxing software isn’t against our EULA. But the same goes in this case, that unless we determine that people are doing things beyond “multiboxing”, we will not be taking any action. We only care about the instances where people are messing with our process for the purposes of cheating, and running multiple clients at the same time is not in violation of our EULA in and of itself unless it involves trial accounts.

### Cycle Clients with Hotkeys

It is possible to set a key combinations to immediately jump to certain EVE window. This applied to either a single client or an ordered list of clients. 

There are an unlimited number of Cycle Groups that you can create which may provide useful if you want to have one HotKey to cycle through a group of DPS characters, while another HotKey cycles through support roles such as gate scouts, or a group of logi.

**Hints** 
* Minimise the use of modifiers or standard keys to minimise issues with the client playing up. In the default example unusual Function keys (e.g. F14) are used which are then bound to a game pad or gaming mouse.
* The Eve client can be somewhat less than stable, often getting confused as client focus switches. It is near certain that you will experience issues such as keys sticking or even in some cases D-Scan running each time the client swaps. So far I have found no perfect solution and opt for the most stable solution instead, of sticking to the F14+ keys.
* For the best experience try to use the Control modifier. In the default example F14 is used to cycle to the next client, but if pressed mid locking a target (Control + Clicking) then the client will not cycle. By registering Control+F4 as an additional hotkey, the client will cycle.
* For a list of supported keys, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys

### Per Client Border Color
Have you ever wanted your main client to show up in a different color so that it more easily catches your eye? Or maybe your Logi to stand out?

EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these per client overrides as yet. Though, It can be done via editing the configuration file directly. 
**Note** Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **PerClientActiveClientHighlightColor**. Most probably it will look like

    "PerClientActiveClientHighlightColor": {
      "EVE - Example Toon 1": "Red",
      "EVE - Example Toon 2": "Green"
    }

You should modify this entry with a list of each of your clients replacing "Example Toon 1", etc with the name of your character. The names on the right represent which highligh color to use for that clients border.

If a client does not appear in this list, then it will use the global highlight color by default.

**Hint** For a list of supported colors see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.color#properties

### Compatibility Mode

This setting allows to enable an alternate thumbnail render. This render doesn't use advanced DWM API to create live previews. Instead it is a screenshot-based render with the following pros and cons:
* `+`  Should work even in remote desktop environments
* `-`  Consumes significantly more memory. In the testing environment EVE-O Preview did consume around 180 MB to manage 3 thumbnails using this render. At the same time the primary render did consume around 50 MB when run in the same environment.
* `-`  Thumbnail images are refreshed at 1 FPS rate
* `-`  Possible short mouse cursor freezes
